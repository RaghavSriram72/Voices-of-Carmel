          <div class="w3-container">
            <p style="text-indent:50px;">I personally believe that going to school is important and we should really try to achieve this goal. However, the virus is very dangerous and risky to many people. Carmel has thousands of students and staff, even if a lot of them choose virtual learning. It would be very hard to social distance in the halls, bathrooms, classrooms, and cafeteria.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">Given the current virus situation, cases are going up in many states. However, we do have a month and a little more to improve. Indiana isn't doing super well, but not as bad as Florida or Texas, two states that have been hit really hard.</span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">More and more people are not being safe about the virus. Whether it be not social distancing or not wearing a mask, people should do better. The best way for safe travel and large group events is to bring and wear masks or face coverings, sanitize your hands and items, and just be cautious.</span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">Simply put it, I think school should open if cases aren't horrible in august and also if people are taking precautions when they are around other people. The risks are heavy, so only time will tell us what is the best choice given our odds.</span></span></p>

            <p style="text-indent:50px;">Opening up Carmel Clay Schools on August 11th is an awful idea. Corona numbers have started to rise again, and by August, the numbers will have most likely peaked. It should also be taken into consideration how many people attend the schools, which would make it extremely difficult to social distance in a small closed space. If Carmel were to reopen<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;">schools, corona would spike, and while teens most likely wouldn't suffer too much from coronavirus symptoms, they would carry it back home to their parents who would have a more difficult time handling the disease.</span></p>

            <p style="text-indent:50px;">Personally, I don't think Carmel Clay Schools should open on November 11th. While having in-person classes may be beneficial for the grades and mental health of some students, its dangerous to have hundreds of kids in one building. There have been almost 50,000 positive cases in Indiana, the number is rising every day.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;">While middle school and high school students may be better at social distancing, elementary-age students most likely wouldn't understand what needs to happen with social distancing in school. I do want the best for students and think we deserve to go back into school, but it's not what’s best for the world, seeing that schools all across the nation are going back as well. In the long end, for our students to stay safe and keep their families safe, Carmel Clay Schools should stay closed until there is a vaccine for Covid-19, or until the curve is flattened.</span></p>

            <p style="text-indent:50px;">In the current situation that we are in I believe reopening schools is an abysmal idea. Though I believe our education is an important priority in this time, it should not be at the risk of our health and safety. If schools were to open, it would be hard to keep social distance in the school especially in places like the cafeterias, classrooms, hallways, etc.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">If Carmel were to reopen, cases would most definitely spike and a lot of people may get sick. This decision can impact a lot of people and their safety, and it should definitely be taken with these important points in mind.

      <div class="w3-container"><p style="text-indent:50px;">Miasdfasdfasdfddle schools should include soccer as a sport in their schools. Soccer is by far the world’s most popular sport and should be a sport at middle schools. Since Middle Schoolers have no way to play soccer for free, they are forced to pay money to get good enough at the sport to play it at the high school. This means that poorer families will never get an opportunity to play this sport<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"> Many people play travel soccer during middle school, if there is a free version, then many families can save expenses and encourage their children to play soccer at school rather than at a soccer club. This can also raise awareness for this sport, which has been largely unpopular in the US compared to other sports. This can give students a better understanding of the culture in other countries and bring more connectivity to other countries.</span></p>

If you decide to disobey these strict guidelines you are ridiculed, teased, and become an exception to what society envisions you to be.

            <h3><b>The Truth about TikTok</b></h3>
            <h5>By Raghav Sriram<br><span class="w3-opacity">July 4th, 2020</span><br><span class="blogtag">Trends</span></h5>

            <p style="text-indent:50px;">During this quarantine, it is easy to spend hours scrolling through TikTok watching short videos of people dancing to famous songs. Personally, in many group chats I’ve been to, many people would share TikToks and react to them. I guess I missed out on the TikTok craze. I’ve never been really interested in downloading the app. I don’t see the point in watching others dance and make short but relatable comedy sketches, but I guess others do. But one thing I’ve noticed is that all the people who use TikTok always seem to be addicted to it. So what makes it so addicting?<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">The premise is simple and is in its name, tik tok is the sound a clock makes giving the implication to users that they can pass time by using this app. Most people who download this app have honorable intentions. They download it to pass time and connect with others, but as they keep on using the app it becomes harder and harder to leave. This situation is incredibly similar to other social media, Snapchat. The more you use Snapchat and TikTok the more you will get addicted and the more time you’ll spend on the app. Similar to narcotics when you first use TikTok it takes a few minutes to get satisfied, but as you keep on using it that satisfaction takes longer to achieve until eventually, it won't bring any happiness at all and just be a waste of time. With social media like TikTok, the harms always seem to outweigh the benefits. In the case of Tiktok it becomes addictive, eventually, a waste of time, makes you feel lonely, increases emotional instability, and does not have any educational benefit.</span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">With that said if you use TikTok responsibly and correctly, it is a valuable resource that can help you meet new people and make everlasting connections through the short videos posted. I hope that after reading this you don’t become addicted to TikTok like some people at NexEdge Innovations :).</span></span></p>

            </div>
            <div class="w3-container">
              <p style="text-indent:50px;">Our country and society have hit some very hard and painful times for many people. Many black people have been unfairly killed or treated horribly because of many racist and evil people/systems. It is right to be outraged and mad at these actions because those people and what they did should not and do not represent our society at all.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">However, I have constantly seen many people get divided or argue. Yes, this is a sensitive issue with many viewpoints, but one major idea still stands: society has made tremendous progress but there are still things that we as humans have to acknowledge and change to create a better world. I think most people would definitely agree that real racism, whether individually or systemically should be stopped. We should all focus on solving these core issues in order to improve our systems in our communities. </span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">Working to stop racism, violence, and injustice shouldn’t be a political issue. I legitimately believe that everyone who has decent morality would agree with me. Everyone needs to unite, educate themselves, and find ways to make their communities better. We need to put aside our differences and work together as one community to truly make the world a better place for everyone. If there is still racism or any type of injustice, we all lose.</span></span></p>

          <h3><b>Why the 2019-20 NBA Season Should Come Back</b></h3>
          <h5>By Eamon Mukhopadhyay<br><span class="w3-opacity">July 4th, 2020</span><br><span class="blogtag">Sports</span></h5>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-container">
          <p style="text-indent:50px;">On March 11th, 2020, the NBA announced the suspension of the season from the CoVid-19 after a Utah Jazz player was diagnosed with Covid-19. Soon after, many players were diagnosed with the virus, which had not been fatal to any player but remained a risk to the people around them. But, officially announced on June 4th, a plan to continue the season starting July 31st was approved by the NBA. Of course, many fans across the globe were extremely excited about the opportunity to see the world’s largest professional basketball league finally continuing, after months of discussion by the league and its players. However, some individual players and even fans object to the change, arguing the virus’s dangers as well as the George Floyd protests would distract the world from its real issues. However, I personally believe that continuing the league is necessary for the league, and here is why.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">First off, the NBA would suffer tremendous financial loss if the season did not re-open this season. Because national broadcasting for the NBA will most likely be at an all-time high (if not, around the top in history), the league will use the opportunity to gain a massive amount of financial gain. If the season did not reopen, it is possible that the league would not have the funds to reopen the 2020-21 season, and that season would be canceled altogether, putting a few players’ careers in jeopardy (some will get older, and their skill-sets will decline). To put it into perspective, the NBA is projected to lose $500 million to 1 billion if officially canceled; with the season re-opening, it will prevent these massive losses which could affect the next season as well.</span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">Second off, the sport of basketball brings everyone together, and it has for many years. The NBA is a very diverse sport, incorporating players from all over the world. It introduces many cultures and different styles of playing the game. The fans also are brought together through their fan bases, and mainly peaceful rivalries between fan bases brings fun competition to the game. The reopening of the NBA season will contribute to the overall spirit of basketball.</span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">Finally, the player’s in the sport will be isolated significantly. There are many set hotels and significant guidelines for players during this time. The players and league officials will be isolated at the Disney Springs Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida, isolated by themselves with their families. The NBA has planned out a tremendous amount of policies between different teams to prevent another Covid-19 shut down, such as referees having to wear masks, and extremely strict testing protocols, as well as the ability for players to be excused (not forced by the league to play, payments are decided by the team).</span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">Bringing people together is what sports can do very well, and the NBA will be able to do that if they reopen the season, saving their own financial situation, while still establishing isolation guidelines to stop CoVid-19 spread. While there are some reasonable Covid-19 scares if the season continues, I strongly believe that re-opening the season will help the league in the long run.</span></span></p>

          <p style="text-indent:50px;">I really hope the MLB returns soon. Players honestly deserve a full pay because they have a skill worth millions.

Many people like me are bored and have almost nothing to watch live. 60 games is the plan, so it would be fun to see a short season with less time to make choices and all that. Maybe we could see an underdog team win it all. Or perhaps an undefeated season. Or history made in only 60 games. I’m excited to watch baseball again for the first time this year.</span></p>

Many skills like teamwork, facing adversity, and maintaining a good mindset will be developed.</span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">Obviously, this year is a horrible exception given the current circumstances. Perhaps next year providing more teams will attract more kids to play sports and improve in many ways, all while having a great time.</span></span></p>

          <h3><b>Why the College Football Playoff Needs to Change</b></h3>
          <h5>By Sam Tan<br><span class="w3-opacity">August 28th, 2020</span><br><span class="blogtag">Sports</span></h5>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-container">
          <p style="text-indent:50px;">College football is very popular across the nation to many people. The exciting games, the major upsets, and the electrifying atmosphere are something else. However, I see one problem with the playoff system. A biased committee decides on just 4 teams to compete for a national title. There are many reasons to add teams or extend them, and I have some good reasons.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">The first one is it would bring in more profit from more national TV coverage and attendance (during normal times). More games with more teams simply means more money and hype for the sport. Schools will also receive good incentives as well for competing in a big game.
          </span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">The next one is it allows for more teams to at least have a chance to compete for a title. For example, in 2017 and 2018, UCF went undefeated in the regular season. They weren’t the best team in the nation but still deserved to at least have a shot at glory. Even more unfair is the fact that there are 5 big conferences, 5 middle to smaller ones, and independents to compete in 4 meager spots. Again, it’s not about being the highest ranked but more so about teams getting a chance to join the action because they deserve an attempt.</span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">     Finally, the committee that ranks teams is biased in some ways. Long time or historical programs that weren’t the best in one season might be ranked higher for their brand name. Also, teams from the power 5 conferences are seen as superior just for being in a their conference sometimes. With more teams representing more of college football as a whole the biases would be less prevalent. This to me is a clear solution to fix this great college sport.</span></span></p>

          <h3><b>Valorant</b></h3>

          <p style="text-indent:50px;">During this quarantine, many have been looking for activities to keep themselves busy. With one of the most popular activities being gaming. One game in particular officially released on June 2, 2020, and has been skyrocketing in popularity ever since. This game is called Valorant, made by Riot Games, who also developed the world-famous, League of Legends.<span class="dots">..</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"><br><br><span style="display:inline-block; text-indent:50px;">Valorant is an online tactical first-person shooter. It launched it’s beta or testing phase on April 7th, 2020. This was the first phase of the games uprise, as many were trying to get their hands on a special chance to play this new and extraordinary game. During this phase, not only was the “hype” unreal but also people were genuinely interested, leading to so many players at the launch.</span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">Personally, after playing a couple of rounds, I must admit that all the excitement was well backed. The game was amazing for me, even though I was new, I found it to be extremely captivating. It had some similarities to other games, but it also had special aspects that really added to the player experience, such as character abilities. As an Omen main, one thing I wish is for more balance changes and updates in the future. Valorant also has animated graphics, meaning it is more suitable for the younger audience. It was definitely something new for the gaming community and it seems that it has been well received. I am eager to see what Valorant has in store for the future. Add me and maybe we can play Shadow101360, #3556 :). Good luck and Have Fun!</span></span></p>

          <h3><b>The Fall of Fortnite</b></h3>
          <h5>By Aeneas Hoffman<br><span class="w3-opacity">July 8th, 2020</span><br><span class="blogtag">Entertainment</span></h5>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-container">
          <p style="text-indent:50px;">I've played Fortnite since the game came out, and I can say from personal experience that it is one of the most fun and exciting games I've played in my life. However, my interest in the game has really dropped lately, for multiple reasons.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">When Fortnite was released, it felt like something I had never experienced before. The sheer excitement of playing the game grasped my interest fully, the feeling felt incredible. It's like a constant feeling of nostalgia that doesn't go away. Up through season 7, the excitement to play the game and the amount of fun I was having was still high. Season 8 came with many big issues. At this point, everybody had become extremely familiar with the game, and therefore the overall skill gap rose dramatically. Players became so good at the game that the fun factor of Fortnite completely disappeared. Content creators had a harder time making content, and their expression was clear. SypherPK, well-known streamer, blamed this on controller players, saying they were "taking over the tournaments." The other big problem was the servers. Lag had been more dramatic than ever, and it just seemed like the servers couldn't keep up. This obviously took away from the overall flow and enjoyability of the game.</span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">Then, out of the blue, Epic released Fortnite Season 2, and with it came a whole new map. Personally, I think it was completely different, however, I don't think it innovated to Fortnite. Despite the new map and graphics, which were worse in my opinion, most of the items were the same, therefore, the game felt no more fun than before. The new bots that were added to ease up the game were useless, and made players feel too confident. So confident to the point where when they met a real player they had to know the idea they were fighting one.</span><br><br><span style="display:inline-block;text-indent:50px;">In conclusion, Fortnite, for me, was less of a roller-coaster and more of a single up and down experience. There was a time of excitement, and from there, it only went down, and never recovered. This is the downfall of Fortnite.</span></span></p>

          <p style="text-indent:50px;">Although high school is some of the most stressful and exciting years of your life, there are a few tips to ensure the best path to success. There are so many ways to improve one’s method of working, such as being as efficient with your time as possible and not procrastinating. The classes that high school offers give you a sense of freedom, but it’s important to be able to achieve success taking those classes. A good area to start <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"> could be taking honors classes to gain a better comprehension of difficult class material and study tips and tricks. It’s crucial to take as many effective notes as possible and to continuously read and understand them. AP classes are also a good idea early on as a way to understand the structure of college classes.<br><br><span style="text-indent:50px;display:inline-block">Now that we have classes out of the way, we can talk about how high school prioritizes freedom for the student. When your day begins, you must be always sitting at your seat when the bell rings. Every passing period, you have time to talk to friends, grab a snack from a vending machine, and even get coffee from the student-run café. Lunch is divided into four different times. Your lunch schedule is organized based on what your third class on blue and gold days are. For example, I had a Biology class during my third class on blue days. Therefore, I was admitted to Lunch A on blue days. Gold days I had an Orchestral class. Therefore, I was admitted to Lunch D. After lunch, you simply follow the rest of your class schedule until the end of your day. When it is time to go, there are various ways to leave the school including the bus, or carpool. Since high school is so close to the library, it can be beneficial to study after school with some friends, to better comprehend a concept for a certain class. And that's pretty much the schedule for an ordinary highschool day. Being a freshman is nerve-racking, I know I was nervous too. But as you go on throughout the year you become more comfortable and maybe some of these tips and tricks could help you get there. Good luck! You got this.</span></span></p>

        <p style="text-indent:50px;">The one secret to being successful in high school is working hard in what you do. Yes, it might sound cliche, but it really does work. If you work hard at school, your classes will become a breeze. You will rarely struggle in class because you will have done all the assignments, which will prepare you for quizzes and tests, which will secure your grades. This will also be very good for your mental health because good grades are very good for your self-esteem. This is not solely applicable to academics.<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"> Hard work can help in extracurriculars from football, to playing to violin, to even doing good in debate club. If you consistently work hard throughout your 4-year stay in high school, you can do most things you want later. Whether you want to play sports for a college, or study science at Harvard, it can all be achieved if you work hard during your high school tenure.</span></p>

          <p style="text-indent:50px;">High Schools should give time for students to exercise during school because it is very beneficial for teenagers to exercise. Currently, 9 out of 10 teens don’t get enough exercise, this is very dangerous and can permanently damage many teens physically and emotionally. <span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"> The benefits of exercise include, it has been proved to improve with academic results in school, it is very healthy for teenagers, resistance training and lifting weights can improve memory, and taking breaks during school can improve classroom performance. All these reasons are benefits of exercise and should be considered by school authorities when trying to implement exercise in school. Exercising in school also reduces the chance of mental illnesses developing. I believe that the school should consider this idea and maybe implement it soon.</span></p>

Soccer is by far the world’s most popular sport and should be a sport at middle schools. Since Middle Schoolers have no way to play soccer for free, they are forced to pay money to get good enough at the sport to play it at the high school. This means that poorer families will never get an opportunity to play this sport<span class="dots">...</span><span class="more" style="display: none;"> Many people play travel soccer during middle school, if there is a free version, then many families can save expenses and encourage their children to play soccer at school rather than at a soccer club. This can also raise awareness for this sport, which has been largely unpopular in the US compared to other sports. This can give students a better understanding of the culture in other countries and bring more connectivity to other countries.</span></p>
